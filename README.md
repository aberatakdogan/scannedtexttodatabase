In this method, I am trying to get text from a scanned picture in Java programming language for a mobile application.

Although I can observe the scanned text in my app, I also want to keep these text data on a database system using Firebase Realtime Database solution.

When I run my app with these method, I encountered the error message on the terminal as provided in the repository.

How can I solve this error or is there any way to save my data to the Realtime Database?
